## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MelodyMLyu/Projects/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### About me
Hi! I am a senior student pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University. I have skills and knowledge essential for Machine Learning, data analysis, FEA, topology optimization utilizing CAE tools (such as HyperWorks suite), and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles which can be supported by my academic courses and co-op experience at Toyota R&D. I have also developed the strong interpersonal and communication skills required to succeed. With my outgoing personality, I bring people together and encourage teammates to innovate and thrive. Throughout all of my experiences, I have used my dedication to efficient, creative problem solving to effectively manage competing demands.

I am currently looking for a full time mechanical engineer position starting in early 2022. Think we should work together? I'd love to hear from you!
